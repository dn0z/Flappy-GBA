How do I build this?
-----------

You can build the gba rom using the **make.bat** file on Windows.  
I tested this using the [devkitadv](http://devkitadv.sourceforge.net/) release 4.


Will this work on a real GBA console?
-----------

I don't know. I don't have a GBA flash cartridge, I only tested this on emulators.


I never die!
-----------

Yeah, the collision detection is not yet implemented.
